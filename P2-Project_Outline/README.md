## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a website that will allow Gloomy Bear collectors to view a stored record of every Gloomy Bear item created. It will allow users to log in and save their own private collection. The project will also allow users to submit other Gloomy Bear items that are not yet listed or might have missing information. 

This project was motivated by the need for Gloomy Bear collectors to have a reliable database to keep track of all Gloomy Bear items as well as their own personal collections.

### What I'll Have to Learn
In order to provide users with the ability to store their own personal collections, I will need to gain more experience with Authentication. I will also need to learn more about using Bootstrap to help with the appearance of my application. 

*Gain more experience with User authentication
*Develop front end skills, likely with Bootstrap to make appealing webpages
